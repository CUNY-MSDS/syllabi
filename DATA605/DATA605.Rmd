### Course Description

The course will provide an overview of the commonly used mathematical techniques in Data Analytics & Statistics. A lot of emphasis will be given to computational techniques and implementing math in programs. Students will be expected to do a fair bit of hands-on programming. We’ll be primarily using R as our programming environment. All assignments will need to be submitted in as R-Markdown documents. Students can expect to walk away with a good under- standing of the kinds of math they’ll need to be successful in the exciting area of Data Analytics


### Course Learning Objectives:

1.	Apply linear algebra to solve data science problems.
2.	Apply probability and statistics to solve data science problems.
3.	Apply univariate and multivariate calculus to solve data science problems.


### Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:

1.	Business Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build data-analytic solutions from an understanding of business goals.
2.	Data Programming. Use industry standard statistical tools and simulation packages.
3.	Foundational Math and Statistics. Emphasis on probability, statistics, and computational methods.
4.	Data Understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.
5.	Prescriptive Modeling. Selecting prescriptive modeling techniques, generating test designs, building and assessing models.
6.	Model Implementation and Deployment. Students will learn to implement mathematical models.
7.	Presentation. Students will deliver presentations of their project results.



### Assignments and grading:

1.	Assignments:   During the course, you will be completing a series of individual assignments, participating in forum discussions, and completing a final examination.
2.	Examinations:  This course has a single examination, a comprehensive final.
3.	Grade Evaluation:  Grades in this course are determined by the percentage of points obtained.

Assignment,Percentage
Homework,15x3% = 45%
Discussions Contribution,15x 1%= 15%
Examination,1x 40%= 40%
Total,100%

### Grading Rubric:

1.	Each homework will be graded as {zero, check minus, check, and check plus}. The associated grades are {0%, 1%, 2%, 3%}.
2.	Discussions are applied analysis from the texts.  You must post a response by Wednesday at midnight (ET) and respond to at least one of your colleagues’ contributions by Saturday at midnight (ET), providing meaningful feedback on the analysis.

###  Late Policy for Homework:

Late work is penalized 20% per day. All assignment due dates and times are shown in Blackboard.

### Course materials all open Source:

Introduction to Probability, Grinstead, C. Snell, J., 1997 

A First Course in Linear Algebra, Beezer, R., 2008 

Linear Regression Using R:  An Introduction to Data Modeling, Lilja, D., 2016
