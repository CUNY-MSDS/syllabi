### Course Description

This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by introducing the key concepts of applied regression modeling and its extensions. The main topics covered in this course include: simple and multiple linear regression, variable selection and shrinkage methods, binary logistic regression, count regression, weighted least squares, robust regression, generalized least squares, multinomial logistic regression, generalized linear models, panel regression, and nonparametric regression. The course is heavily weighted towards practical application using the R statistical programming language and data sets containing missing values and outliers. The course also addresses issues of exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model development, model validation, and model deployment


### Course Learning Outcomes:

•	Demonstrate a practical understanding of the theoretical concepts behind applied regression modeling.
•	Analyze and select appropriate types and combinations of models given particular business situations.
•	Develop applied regression modeling techniques to address different types of data.
•	Use R statistical software to build and deploy specific models based on real-world business problems.


### Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:

•	Business Understanding. Students will learn how applied regression modeling techniques can add value to existing business analytics.
•	Data Programming. Use industry standard statistical programming tools.
•	Foundational Math and Statistics. Emphasis on probability, statistics, and computational methods.
•	Data Culture. Students will learn how applied regression modeling can enhance business capabilities and extend the value of existing data.
•	Data Understanding. Students will learn how to explore data to find new patterns.
•	Predictive Modeling. Selecting predictive modeling techniques, building and assessing models.
•	Model Implementation. Students will learn to implement models for the various applied regression modeling techniques covered in the course


### How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?

Regression modeling skills are crucial, high-value skills in today’s data-driven business environment where real-world decision-making processes are complex. The ability to leverage rapidly expanding data sets to obtain new insights is at the heart of predictive data analytics.
