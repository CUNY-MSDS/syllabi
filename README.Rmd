## Syllabi by Semester

```{r, echo=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(rmarkdown)
library(tidyverse)

semesters <- list.dirs('docs', recursive = FALSE) 
semesters <- data.frame(
	year = substr(semesters, 6, 9),
	semester = substr(semesters, 10, nchar(semesters))
)
semesters$semester <- factor(semesters$semester, 
							 levels = c('Spring', 'Fall'),
							 ordered = TRUE)
semesters <- semesters %>% dplyr::arrange(desc(year), desc(semester))

for(j in 1:nrow(semesters)) {
	year <- semesters[j,]$year
	semester <- semesters[j,]$semester
	courses <- list.files(paste0('docs/', year, semester),
						  pattern = paste0(year, '-', semester, '.html'))
	
	courses <- gsub(paste0('-', year, '-', semester, '.html'), '', courses)
	# courses <- substr(courses, 1, 7)

	cat(paste0('\n\n### ', semester, ' ', year, '\n\n'))
	
	for(i in courses) {
		y <- yaml_front_matter(paste0(i, '/', i, '.Rmd'))
		html_file <- paste0('docs/', year, semester, '/', i, '-', year, '-', semester, '.html')
		pdf_file <- paste0('docs/', year, semester, '/', i, '-', year, '-', semester, '.pdf')
		html_url <- paste0('https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CUNY-MSDS/syllabi/blob/main/',
					   html_file)
		title <- y$title
		title <- gsub('![CUNY SPS Logo](../includes/SPS1line_blue.jpg){width=6.5in}  \n',
					  '',
					  title, fixed = TRUE)
		if(file.exists(html_file)) {
			cat(paste0('* [', title, '](', pdf_file, ')\n'))
		} else {
			cat(title)
		}
		# if(file.exists(html_file)) {
		# 	cat(paste0('* [', y$title, '](', html_url, ') ([PDF](', pdf_file, '))\n'))

	}
}
```


## Notes for Instructors

Each course, located in a folder `DATAXXX` where `XXX` is the course number, should have at minimum two files:

* `DATAXXX.Rmd` - the main document for the syllabus. I recommend starting with the provided [Template.Rmd](Template.Rmd) file.
* `DATAXXX.xlsx` - an Excel file with at least three columns:
	* `Week` - the week number (1 through 14)
	* `Duration` - the number of weeks that unit extends. For example, if each unit is two weeks, then `Week`s should be set to 1, 3, 5, etc. and `Duration` would be 2.
	* `Topic` - a description of that unit.
	* You can include additional columns (e.g. readings) as appropriate. See the *Including the Schedule* details below on how to include those columns in the syllabus.

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is a special version of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that allows the combination of R code and text.


##### Common Sections

There are a number of files in the `includes` directory for parts of the syllabus that are common for all syllabi.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
mds <- list.files('includes/', pattern = '*.md')
for(i in mds) {
	cat('* `', i, '`\n')
}
```

These can be included into your syllabus using the following syntax (replacing the filename with one of the files listed above):

````markdown
`r ''````{r, child='../includes/accessibility.md'}
```
````

##### Including the Schedule

The R chunk below will build the schedule table for the Excel file specified. This function merges the course schedule, specified with weeks, to the master schedule which has date ranges for the given semester. This function will also build an appropriate for the output format (i.e. HTML or PDF).

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
source('../build_schedule.R')
build_schedule('DATAXXX.xlsx', year = params$year, semester = params$semester)
```
````



##### Building Your Syllabus

The easiest way to build your syllabus to check for formatting issues is to use the `build_syllabi` function. The following commands will build the syllabus for the Spring 2021 semester (you may build for any semester that has a schedule in the `Schedules` folder).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source('build_syllabi.R')
build_syllabi('DATAXXX', semester = 'Spring', year = 2021)
```

By default, the syllabus will be built into the `docs/2021Spring/` folder, however you can override this by specifying the `out_dir` parameter. This function will be build four versions of the sylabus:

* A plain markdown version (`.md`).
* An HTML version (`.html`).
* A partial HTML version (`_partial.html`) which does not include header of footer information that is appropriate to embed in another website.
* A PDF version (`.pdf`)


## Notes for Adminstrators

The `Schedules` folder should contain an Excel file for each semester. The file should use the following naming convention: `YYYY-SEMESTER.xlsx`. This fill will be used by the `build_schedule` function in the `build_schedule.R` R script. The Excel file should have one sheet with the following three columns:

* `Week` - The week number (i.e. 1 through 15). Note that some semesters will only have 14 weeks. Any syllabi that specify a 15th week will not have a date associate with that week but the content will still be included in the syllabus. Going forward, courses whould be designed to fit within a 14-week schedule.
* `Start` - The first day of the week (typically Monday except for the first week of the semester). Be sure to use a date format for the column in Excel.
* `End` - The last day of the week (typically Sunday execpt for the last week of the semester). Be sure to use a date format for the column in Excel.

The `build_syllabi.R` R script contains one function `build_sullabi` which has three parameters:

* `courses` - This is a character vector of all the courses that should be built for a given semester (i.e. courses that are being offered).
* `semester` - The semester to build, should either be `Spring` or `Fall`.
* `year` - The year of the semester.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
source('build_syllabi.R')
build_syllabi(courses = c('DATA606', 'DATA607'),
			  semester = 'Spring', year = 2021)
```
